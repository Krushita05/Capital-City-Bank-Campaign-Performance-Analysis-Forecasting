# Capital-City-Bank-Campaign-Performance-Analysis-Forecasting
Analyzed Capital City Bank's Best Depositor Campaign (Q1-Q3) using Power BI to track conversion rates, household demographics, and marketing efficiency. Developed a Q4 predictive model that identified high-net-worth customers for a credit card referral initiative. Improved targeting strategy to drive highest customer acquisition and ROI.

# Project Description:
The project was to analyze Capital City Bank's Best Depositor Campaign performance from Q1 to Q3 and forecast Q4 performance. The primary objective was to assess conversion rates, product usage, household profiles, and demographic trends to tune marketing efforts.

Through Power BI, the project provided interactive dashboards for tracking key performance indicators, including campaign cost efficiency, household reach, and cost per conversion. A segmentation model was also developed to target high-net-worth individuals ($75K-$99K income range) within the 40-50 and 60-70 age ranges as a target market for a new credit card referral program.

For Q4 forecasting, a marketing strategy based on incentives was suggested to increase the adoption of credit cards. Customers were offered up to $100 in bonuses for achieving eligibility criteria. The data-driven strategy was aimed at improving customer retention and acquisition and thereby marketing ROI for Capital City Bank.
